      <description>Finally, after few attempts I decided to move all my posts from tumblr blog to octopress. There were few reasons behind this decision:
 I like having entire blog under my own control. Octopress keeps whole the stuff under git which gives history of all changes, branches and tags. Thatâ€™s really awesome for programmer like me. Hosting on github. There are not enough words to express how github revolutionized my daily workflow.</description>
